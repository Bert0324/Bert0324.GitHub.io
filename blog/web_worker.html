In order to improve its calculation performance, like other languages' multiple threads function, Web Worker can create a new thread that can be in charge of CPU-bound tasks. For example: ```js //main thread const worker = new Worker('worker.js'); worker.postMessage('Hi'); worker.onmessage = e => { console.log(e.data); worker.terminate(); } //web worker importScripts('....'); //load other reource const _self = this; _self.addEventListener('message', e => { console.log(e.data); _self.postMessage('I am working'); }) ``` Except using a independent as Web Worker, a Blob object can be too. like: ```js const task = new Blob([`importScripts('....'); //load other reource const _self = this; _self.addEventListener('message', e => { console.log(e.data); _self.postMessage('I am working'); })`], { type: 'application/javascript' }); const worker = new Worker(URL.createObjectURL(task)); worker.postMessage('Hi'); worker.onmessage = e => { console.log(e.data); worker.terminate(); } ``` ## Worker-loader [worker-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/worker-loader) uses webpack to pack worker.js file to string and load in main thread, which is more convenient to use and maintain. ## Differences compared to main thread Compared to main thread, Web Worker has some limits such as: ### same source the script file loaded by Web Worker must from the same source of main thread script file. ### DOM operation Web Worker cannot operate DOM, any DOM operation should be in main thread script. window.navigator and location is accessible in Web Worker. ### context Web Worker has an independent context, any communication with main thread has to transfer by message.</div></div></body></html>
