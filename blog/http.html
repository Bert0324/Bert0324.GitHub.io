<p>TCP/IP protocol can provide a reliable link between two computers, if packet get lost, it is re-transmitted. TCP itself rides on top of IP, which provides unified addressing to communicate between computers. TCP/IP is a basis for internet and 99% of other networks.</p>
<p>How TCP/IP guarantee its reliability of transmission? The key point is to .</p>
<h3 id="connection-establishment">Connection Establishment</h3>
<p>The setup steps make sure both of them can receive and send data to each other.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the client send a SYN to the server. In this step, the server knows it can receive data from the client.</p>
</li>
<li><p>the server replies with a SYN-ACK. In this step, the client knows it can receive data and send data to the server.</p>
</li>
<li><p>the client sends an ACK back to the server. In this step, the server knows the client can receive data it sent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="connection-termination">Connection Termination</h3>
<p>The termination uses a four-way handshake, with each side of the connection terminating independently.</p>
<p>Each side needs to send a FIN and ACK packet to another side. Therefore, a typical tear-down requires a pair of FIN and ACK segments from each TCP endpoint.</p>
<p>There is a picture to show it:</p>
<img src="../assets/tcp_teardown.png" width="400"/>

<p>Why the initiator needs to wait for 2 maximum segment lifetime?</p>
<p>If the receiver doesn&#39;t get its ACK packet from the initiator, it will resend a FIN to the initiator. It can guarantee the connection can be teardown safely.</p>
<h2 id="message-structure">Message Structure</h2>
<p>HTTP requests, and responses, share similar structure and are composed of:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A start-line describing the requests to be implemented, or its status of whether successful or a failure. This start-line is always a single line.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An optional set of HTTP headers specifying the request, or describing the body included in the message.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A blank line indicating all meta-information for the request has been sent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An optional body containing data associated with the request (like content of an HTML form), or the document associated with a response. The presence of the body and its size is specified by the start-line and HTTP headers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
