The past recent decades witnessed the rapid worldwide development of industrialization and its destroy to the nature, especially for the diversity of wildlife species. Some people insist that it is time to protect animal species, while others argue that quantities of society problems are more worthwhile. Personally speaking, the former view can more win my favor.

It is an indisputable fact that a plenty of society problems deserve the attention of the public. These problems are threating a plenty of people's lives, especially in those least developed countries. For example, thousands of people are in a dilemma of food shortage, naturally food problem is their top concern instead of species protection. Therefore, it is fair to say that the government is supposed to pay attention to those society problems.

However, there is no doubt that the extinction of animals is one of the most urgent problems. The disappearance of a animal is irreparable and will be prone to more other species' extinction. Considering normally there are tight connections among different species, the extinction of one species usually has a chain effect, leading to the extinction of another species. Hence, without actions, the speed of extinction will be faster. Compared to society problems, the extinction of animals also require the authority to take immediate actions, such as implement more strict policies to protect nature reserves, to make a significant improvement on this phenomenon.

To summarize, although citizens are suffering from numerous society problems, human beings still ought to take a variety of environment protection actions to rebuild the population and diversity of wildlife. After all, human beings only have one mother earth.
