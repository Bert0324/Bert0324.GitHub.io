Transport accidents lead to a large number of death all over the world, it is not surprised that there is an opinion that divers are supposed to pass vehicle examination yearly. I totally disagree with it.

Obviously, it is a fact the test cannot guarantee the security of roads. As far as I am concerned, Majority of accidents are origin from divers' ignorance of transport regulations, instead of the lack of transportation knowledge. Particularly, different with public's stereotype, most of accidents were made by experienced divers. The reason is that compared to them, newbies are more careful to driving, such as paying more attention to traffic lights and passengers.

Besides, it can be a waste to post the event for both individuals and the government. For an individual, driving technical is inclined to become outdated. As with the rapid development of auto driving technology, human drivers are allowed to learn less relevant knowledge. If the test is implied, it is predictable that they need to repeat similar work to prepare test. As a result, they cannot afford a plenty of time in family and society commitment. Also, for the government, organizing a test over whole country can be a challenge. Considering there are so many more worthy things to do, such as economic development and education revolution, the test is a completely a waste of human resource and government expenditure.

To summarize, a yearly driving test is not necessary in the society. Not only because there is no connection among the test and accident happening, but also because of the coming of auto driving technology.
