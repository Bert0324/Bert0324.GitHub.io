## P2

### Questions

Describe an item of clothing that someone gave you

You should say:
- What the clothing was
- Who gave it to you
- When you got it
- And explain why this person gave you the clothing

### Thinking

- Chinese tunic suit
- To celebrate our graduation from high school, I would participate in a chorus program, which required all performers wear Chinese tunic suits
- The organizers rented a Chinese tunic suit for everyone
- It was black, with two pockets on the chest
- The size didn't fit very well, as it was not tailored
- worried about trousers will fall down
- put hands in pockets of trousers to hold them
- Thankfully, the program was a success, what I feared did not happen
- It was not a pleasant experience, but very memorable
- dislike formal wears, like suits
- wear T-shirts, short pants, and sandals in the workspace
- compared to formal wears, it makes me feel more comfortable and natural, helping me focus on my work, instead of my dress
