source: <https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/>

## Question

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## 思路

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let max = -Infinity;
  let ret = 0;
  for (let i = prices.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const v = max - prices[i];
    max = Math.max(max, prices[i]);
    if (v > ret) ret = v;
  }
  return ret;
};
```
