# To record some of JS knowledge points

In my daily work, I found sometimes it is quite difficult to know some of knowledge points comprehensively.

So I decide to class different points to groups.

## JS basis

* [0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3](/js_basis/epsilon.md)
* [Deep copy and Shallow copy in JS](/js_basis/object_copy.md)
* [slice, substr and substring](/js_basis/string_process.md)

## Modularization

* [webpack how works](/module/webpack_structure.md)

## Asynchronize

* [Promise](/asynchronize/promise.md)

## Web API

* [Event Proxy](/web_api/events_proxy.md)

## NetWork

* [Http2](/network/http2.md)


## React

* [Refs](/react/refs.md)
* [Keys](/react/keys.md)
* [Life cycle]()

## Node.JS

* [Cross Domain](/nodejs/cross_domain.md)
* [Passport.JS structure](/nodejs/passport.md)

## Algorithm

* [Flat an Array](/algorithm/flat_array.md)

## Other
