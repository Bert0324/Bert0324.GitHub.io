# To record some of JS knowledge point

In my daily work, I found sometimes it is quite difficult to know some of knowledge points comprehensively.

So I decide to class different points to various groups.

## JS basis

## Module

## Asynchronize

* [Promise](/asynchronize/promise.md)

## Web API

## NetWork


## React

## Node.JS
