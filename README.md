# To record some of JS knowledge point

In my daily work, I found sometimes it is quite difficult to know some of knowledge points comprehensively.

So I decide to class different points to various groups.

## JS basis

## Module

## Asynchronize

* [Promise](/asynchronize/promise.md)

## Web API

* [Event Proxy](/web_api/events_proxy.md)

## NetWork

* [Http2](/network/http2.md)


## React

## Node.JS

## Algorithm

* [Flat an Array](/algorithm/flat_array.md)
