## issue a npm project

Firstly, make sure the npm has been initialized in the project. Next next, input:

```
npm login
```

and enter your username, password, email in [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/). After that, input:

```
npm publish
```

It will ask to enter some information of the package, actually, it is the same fields of package.json, which can be 
edited after publishing.

One tip, the same version number is not allowed, so every time before publishing, it is imperative to change version number 
in package.json. 

For more information about the package.json fields, [npm-package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json)
